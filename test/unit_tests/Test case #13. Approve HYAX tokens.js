/*
  The following test cases were built around accounting-related consistency and specific user flows
  As secondary goal the tests are made to validate gas efficiency.

  Scope: The scope of the following test cases is the HYAX smart contract functions
  Approach: The tests to be performed will be Unit tests (for trivial functions) and Integration tests (for complex functions)
  Resources: The tool to use for the following tests is the Hardhat specialized test runner based on ethers.js
